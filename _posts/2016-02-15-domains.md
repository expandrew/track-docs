### Domain Scheme

| Domain                | What                        | Hosting |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-|
| `expandrew.com`       | Information pages*           | (none yet) |
| `x.expandrew.com`     | Main front-end application  | Heroku (`expandrew-track-frontend`) |
| `api.expandrew.com`   | Main back-end API           | Heroku (`expandrew-track-api`) |
| `docs.expandrew.com`  | Documentation site          | GitHub Pages ([`expandrew/track-docs`](http://github.com/expandrew/track-docs)) |

*\*Might move the main front-end application to run off of `expandrew.com` at some point; for now, this is an information page with colophon information and links to the application and its documentation.*
