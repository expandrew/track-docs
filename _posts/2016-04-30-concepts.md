## Item

Every datum in **expandrew/track** is an "item." 

An item has the following:

- ID: unique identifier for the item; reachable from a URL
- Type: denotes the item's type, for rendering on the front-end
- Privacy: integer value that represents the item's degree of visibility
- Content: a JSON blob representing the fields and data held by the item

### Item Privacy

This is a draft of my concept of privacy in the project. Definitions may change, but the four-level concept will stay.

- **1**: Public; "expected to be discovered"; "featured info"
- **2**: Semi-public; "can be discovered if desired"; "supplemental info"
- **3**: Semi-private; "should not be discovered without authorization"; "TMI"
- **4**: Private; "cannot be discovered without authorization"; "secrets"
