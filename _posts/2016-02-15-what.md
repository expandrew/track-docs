**expandrew/track** is my eternal full-stack web experiment.

## What it does

**expandrew/track** is a place for me to keep track of things like the following:

- notes (ideas, sketches, thoughts, records, etc)
- bookmarks (articles, technical, videos, etc)
- list items (to-do, grocery, wish, lookup, etc)
- things I own (personal inventory, clothing, etc)
- audio recordings (voice memos, violin practice, etc)
- silo posts (scrobbles, tweets, Instagram, Tumblr, etc)
- whatever I plug into it (exercise, gas mileage, meals, etc)

It has a simple front-end application for input and UI, and a back-end application/database layer that handles the data.

## How it's built

The architecture is designed to allow me to rewrite any of the individual pieces when frameworks go out of style.

**expandrew/track** is made up of the following:

- a single-page application front-end layer
- a RESTful back-end API layer
- a cloud-hosted database layer
- a documentation site for documenting the decisions and quirks along the way

The documentation site exists to keep track of the project's specs (API docs, project features, etc.) so rewriting a layer should be less painful when the time comes around.
